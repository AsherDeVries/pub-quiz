# Quizzer Design Document

The Quizzer is a web application that can be used in bars, sports canteens and maybe even prisons to play quizzes as a team. A pub quiz, basically.
It consists of 3 client applications and 1 server application.

## Technologies

|Tech|Description|Rationale|
|----|-----------|---------|
|Node.js|Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.||
|Express|Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.||
|React|Fast, composable client-side components.||
|MongoDB|MongoDB is an open-source, document database designed for ease of development and scaling.||
|Websocket|A computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.||
|Mongoose|Mongoose is a MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment.|For easy schema creation and validation|
|React UIkit Components|Collection of React components using the UIkit CSS framework.|The programmers have more experience with UIkit|
|Axios|Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js.|To prevent callback hell.|
|Mocha Test|Mocha is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js and in the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and fun.||
|Chai|Chai is a BDD / TDD assertion library for node and the browser that can be delightfully paired with any javascript testing framework.|For more readable tests|
|Supertest|The motivation with this module is to provide a high-level abstraction for testing HTTP, while still allowing you to drop down to the lower-level API provided by superagent.||
|SocketIO|Socket.IO enables real-time bidirectional event-based communication.||

## Architecture

The clients primarily use websocket connections for all communication. HTTP requests are only used for retrieving data from the MongoDB backend.

## API Spec & Websocket Message formats

The text below describes the REST api specification of the server. Which endpoints can be accessed, by which url and what there responses look like.

### REST

#### List categories

List all categories which can be used in the quiz.

```GET /categories```

##### Response

```
{
  "name": String
}
```

### Websocket

### Database structure
