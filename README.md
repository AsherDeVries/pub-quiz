# Quizzer Design Document

The Quizzer is a web application that can be used to organize quizzes in which participants can play in teams. A pub quiz, basically.
In order to run Quizzer locally, 4 "sub" applications and a single database are needed. The sub applications are technically two web applications, a scoreboard and a server.

**Web application 1: Team app**  
The application in which teams can join a quiz and submit answers.

**Web application 2: Quizzer master app**  
The app in which the quizmaster can start and manage a quiz sessions. the master has control over when the quiz starts and ends, who joins the quiz, which answers will be asked and which of them are correct.

**Scoreboard**  
The Quizzer's scoreboard displays the current scores of the participating teams during and after the quiz. 

**Server**  
The server within Quizzer keeps hold of the current quiz session. It keeps every sub application up to date with the quiz session's current data.

**Database**  
The database within Quizzer is used to temporarily cache data about the quiz, so it can be recovered if something goes wrong (immediate server crash).  

## Architecture

The clients primarily use websocket connections for all communication. HTTP requests are only used for retrieving data from the MongoDB backend.

## API Spec & Websocket Message formats

The text below describes the REST api specification of the server. Which endpoints can be accessed, by which url and what there responses look like.

### REST

The paragraph below lists each REST endpoint which can be accessed from the Quizzer's server.

#### List question categories

List all the question's categories which can be used in the quiz.

```GET /categories```

##### Response

```
{
  "name": String
}
```

#### List available questions

List all questions of which the quiz master can choose to ask during a quiz session.

```GET /questions```

##### Response

```
{
  [
    {
      "name" : String,
      "category" : String,
      "correctAnswer" : String
    }
  ]
}
```

## Technologies

|Tech|Description|Rationale|
|----|-----------|---------|
|Node.js|Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.||
|Express|Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.||
|React|Fast, composable client-side components.||
|MongoDB|MongoDB is an open-source, document database designed for ease of development and scaling.||
|Websocket|A computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.||
|Mongoose|Mongoose is a MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment.|For easy schema creation and validation|
|React UIkit Components|Collection of React components using the UIkit CSS framework.|The programmers have more experience with UIkit|
|Axios|Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js.|To prevent callback hell.|
|Mocha Test|Mocha is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js and in the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and fun.||
|Chai|Chai is a BDD / TDD assertion library for node and the browser that can be delightfully paired with any javascript testing framework.|For more readable tests|
|Supertest|The motivation with this module is to provide a high-level abstraction for testing HTTP, while still allowing you to drop down to the lower-level API provided by superagent.||
|SocketIO|Socket.IO enables real-time bidirectional event-based communication.||
